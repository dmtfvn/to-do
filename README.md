# Simple to-do web app

An everyday helper, contributing to keep track of your things to do. They can be marked when completed, or unmarked, if not. The state of a task is saved, and If one is no longer needed, it can be deleted as well.

This project was entirely created by using pure vanilla javascript.

## The web app can be used on any device - desktop, tablet, or mobile.
