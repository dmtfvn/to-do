## Simple to-do web app ðŸ“‹

An everyday helper, contributing to keep track of your things to do. They can be marked when completed, or unmarked, if not. The state of a task is saved, and If one is no longer needed, it can be deleted as well.  

#### The web app can be used on any device (desktop, tablet, mobile device), simply by locating it at [TO DO](https://dmtfvn.github.io/to-do/)
